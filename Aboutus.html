    <div id="text"><h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>Well that's a tough question; to fully understand what we're about, you have to look at everything that we do, and that includes our   dance, teaching, living hip hop culture, and sharing with the community. </p>
        <p>You can also check out our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_lREOX2qCk" target="_blank">crew trailer!</a></p>

        <h3>What We Do in Brief</h3>
        <p>We're Kingston's best breakers/bboys/"breakdancers". We represent Hip Hop to the fullest, and share knowledge through workshops and our classes. We practice day and night for shows (ok, maybe not that often) and always want to push ourselves. As a university club, we also promote excellent time management skills, and coincidentally we attract some of the brightest minds at Queen's University. </p>
        <p>We also believe in the unifying nature of hip hop, and organize quite a few dope events (and parties). There's the annual Forgotten Styles bboy jam, fun-tastic house parties and movie screenings of dope bboy flicks. </p>
        <h3>Services We Offer</h3>
        <p><b>Performances:</b> Name a place and time and we'll bust out the cardboard</p><p><b>Workshops:</b> We'll come to you and drop some knowledge</p><p><b>Classes:</b> We run classes during the school year every Saturday in the ARC!</p>

        <h3>A Bit of History</h3>
        <p>We started in 2009, as the old WreckBreakz members were just graduating (the crew before them was QKids, and they were dope). Back then, we were still using the PEC, and always made fun of the elevator that had a can-on-a-string for emergency calls. Backstreet (aka Li) did up our first logo, and we had a our first performance at Synergy Fashion Show. Not too shabby heh. </p>
        <p>We've grown a lot since then. Our number goal has always been to promote bboying and its roots at Queen's and now we are expanding that reach to outside of Queen's and are working towards building up our own little chunk of town-gown relations. We started at Boys & Girls, helping out Emma (one of the co-founders of Flow and staunch KinetiQ member), and we recently spearheaded the Urban Dance Project with the city of Kingston, teaching local youth. </p>
