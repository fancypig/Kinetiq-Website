    <h3>What is BBoying?</h3>
        <p>First of all, <span class="emphasis">bboying</span> is FUN. It was created by children from the ghettos of <span class="emphasis">New York City</span> to express the boundless energy of their youth through non-destructive means. Coinciding with the birth of deejaying, emceeing and graffiti, these artforms are said to form the pillars of the culture known as hip hop.</p>
      <h3>What about 'breakdancing'?</h3>
        <p>Breakdancing was the term coined by media corporations during the 80s to describe some of the visual aspects bboying. This distinction is important because, like most mass-consumer-culture-appropriations, it only shows the public merely one aspect of this exceptionally multifaceted culture. </p>
        <p>In doing so, they exploited what the young dancers created, and left little opportunity for those youth who actually created something out of nothing; meanwhile, the media corporations appropriated large profits for themselves. As a result, most of the public generally views bboying as 'one of those streetdances', often lumping it with popping, locking, and electric boogaloo which are dances in their own right. </p>
        <p>They have no idea what it is, and new generations have less opportunity to figure out the truth following the wake of a series of new mainstream 'streetdance' films. In a sense it is a cultural genocide as hip hop continues to be misrepresented, with corporations taking advantage of the economic plight of many dancers, turning them into showboys and monkeys. </p>
